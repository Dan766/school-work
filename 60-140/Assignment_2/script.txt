Individual Assignment 2

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Requirements 


A fashion model moved from England to Canada. When she checked her weight 

last in England, she weighed 54 Kg. She was surprised to see her weight in Canada 

on the weighing scale as 140 lbs in her first week. She then weighed 135 lbs 

during her second week in Canada. When she visited England after 2 months, her 

weight was 52 Kg. You are required to write a C program to determine the 

additional weight (in + or -) gained by the model in Canada during her first 2 

weeks as well as the additional weight (in + or -) gained by the model 2 months 

after, when she visited England. You can measure each weight gain from the last 

previous known weight with the unit used at the location of the measuring time (if 

England, unit is Kg and if Canada, unit is lbs). (Hint: 1 Kg = 2 lbs).

Components Analysis



Input:

weight_week_0	(real)

weight_week_1	(real)

weight_week_2	(real)

weight_month_2	(real)



Constants:

one_lbs_to_kg	(real)

one_kg_to_lbs	(real)





Output:

gain_week_1		(real)

gain_week_2		(real)

gain_month_2	(real)



Relationship:

	gain_week_1 = weight_week_1-(weight_week_0*one_kg_to_lbs);

	gain_week_2 = weight_week_2-weight_week_1;

	gain_month_2 = weight_month_2-(weight_week_2*one_lbs_to_kg);
